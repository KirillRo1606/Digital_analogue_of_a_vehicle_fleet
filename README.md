See README.

Developed a digital analogue of a vehicle fleet
Conditions:
- The vehicle fleet should include various types of transport (freight, passenger, cargo-passenger).
- Each vehicle must have its own characteristics, both general (for example, year of manufacture, make and model, type of fuel used, its consumption...) and special (for example, body volume and carrying capacity for transportation, cargo transportation and passenger capacity - for transporting passengers).
- Similar to the methods: there should be both general (for example, refuel and repair) and specific (for example, disinfect the interior for buses and seal the body for trucks).
- Trucks must have different types of bodies and, accordingly, different options for transported goods (for example, manufactured goods can be transported in tilt trucks, manufactured goods and perishable products can be transported in refrigerators, liquids can be transported in tanks, etc.).
- It is also necessary to provide for the fulfillment of transportation orders. The order must include the starting and ending points, as well as the volume, weight and type of cargo for cargo transportation or the number of passengers for passenger transportation. It must be possible to fulfill and unload an order to/from a specific vehicle. Each vehicle must be able to view the available capacity, volume (any number of seats) and orders that are currently loaded into the vehicle.
Development result:
- Object-oriented description of the vehicle fleet.
- It is required to simulate the work (create several vehicles, refuel and service them, load/unload several orders).
